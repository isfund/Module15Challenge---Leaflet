# Module15Challenge---Leaflet

In this project is a visualization of global earthquake data, I plotted using the Leaflet.js mapping library. The map provides an interactive view of earthquake locations, with markers.

Features
Earthquake Visualization: Earthquakes are plotted based on their geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude).

The size of each marker represents the magnitude of the earthquake.
The color of each marker represents the depth of the earthquake, with darker colors indicating greater depths.
Tectonic Plate Visualization: Tectonic plate boundaries are drawn on the map in orange, providing insight into the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
